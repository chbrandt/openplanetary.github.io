# OpenPlanetary Members and Contributors Guide

## Blog

Our blog is hosted on Medium as _Publication_: *OpenPlanetary* (http://medium.com/openplanetary). See it a little bit like a 'GitHub organization' vs your 'GiHub account'...

- Once your account created, you can draft, edit and publish your own _Stories_ (posts), and you can decide to submit them in OpenPlanetary publication if you want. You need to be added as _Writer_ for that. Just ask us by [email](mailto:hello@openplanetary.co), or via Slack (to [Nicolas](https://openplanetary.slack.com/messages/nmanaud) or [Angelo](https://openplanetary.slack.com/messages/arosp)).
- Publication's _Editors_ can review submissions, add stories, edit and publish submitted drafts, and remove any stories from this publication.
