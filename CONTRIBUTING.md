# OpenPlanetary Members and Contributors Guide

You can contribute to OpenPlanetary in several ways.

## Blog

Our blog is hosted on Medium as _Publication_: *OpenPlanetary*(http://medium.com/openplanetary). See it a little bit like a 'GitHub organization' vs your 'GiHub account'...

- Once your account created, you can draft, edit and publish your own _Stories_ (posts), and you can decide to submit them in OpenPlanetary publication if you want. You need to be added as _Writer_ for that (just ask @nmanaud or @aprossi).
- Publication's _Editors_ can review submissions, add stories, edit and publish submitted drafts, and remove any stories from this publication. If you want to be an OpenPlanetary Publication Editor, ask @nmanaud or @aprossi.
